# TryHackMe: Brute It Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough for the **Brute It** room on TryHackMe. This room challenges you to explore various aspects of reconnaissance, brute-forcing, and privilege escalation. Below are the detailed steps taken to complete the room, along with the answers to each task's questions.

**Link to the room:** [Brute It - TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/bruteit)

## Task 1 - About this box

Deploy the machine and get ready to start exploring.

*No answer needed.*

## Task 2 - Reconnaissance

### Step 1: Port Scanning
First, we perform a port scan using `nmap` to identify open ports on the target machine.

```bash
nmap -vv -T4 -p- 10.10.14.82
```

Answer:

How many ports are open?
2

### Service Enumeration
Next, we check the versions of the services running on the open ports.

SSH version:
- OpenSSH 7.6p1

Apache version:
- 2.4.29

Linux distribution:
- Ubuntu

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p80,22 10.10.14.82
```

### Directory Enumeration
We can use a directory brute-forcing tool like gobuster to search for hidden directories on the web server.

Here I chose to use nikto

Answer:

Hidden directory:
/admin

```bash
nikto -h 10.10.14.82
```


## Task 3 - Getting a Shell

Accessing the Admin Panel
Navigate to the /admin directory and locate the login form. 


![thm-brute-it-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247419ae-7305-4b8a-af44-42ec5c143e95)

Using common credentials, we attempt to brute-force the login to access the admin panel.  

![thm-brute-it-6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cf4699c-6c9e-4385-a5df-b62db26b99e4)

The View Page Source info reveals that the login form uses a POST method for form data, such as usernames and passwords, to the server via an HTTP POST request.  Also, a hint is provided to answer a question for this task.


![thm-brute-it-5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/408f63f2-d46d-41e6-a273-a311945a667c)


Using Burpsuite to view the POST request containing the attempted login with the username and a random password combination:

### HYDRA

Using Hydra to brute-force the form password:

What is the user:password of the admin panel?
- admin:xavier

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.14.82 http-post-form "/admin/index.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid"
```

![thm-brute-it-8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/660cfee0-fdad-4058-a01d-c0cc1f653673)

We use these credentials to login to the web form and we are then presented with the following:

Collect the flag. Then, download the RSA key by clicking on the hyperlink on the webpage:

![thm-brute-it-9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df2f0534-0271-40b5-9b6d-10c4568cf669)

The RSA private key contains the following:


![thm-brute-it-10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/597d60c3-79e7-48d3-879e-842c4c687312)


Change the file permissions to enable owner read and write permissions 

```bash
sudo chmod 600 id_rsa
```
Initiate a secure shell connection to the target machine:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa john@10.10.14.82
```

![thm-brute-it-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1897ff42-e9fc-4abe-b3d7-256b7960d879)

Oops, it looks like we need to find a passphrase first...

SSH2John is the tool of choice. We can use it to extract the SSH hash from the key file:

```bash
sudo python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > johnkey.hash
```

![thm-brute-it-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece9071c-7492-48ae-badf-e5e16a2aa4af)

And now we can use this hash with John the Ripper tool to crack the passphrase:

### Cracking the RSA Key
After obtaining an RSA key, we use John the Ripper to crack the key's passphrase.

What is John's RSA Private Key passphrase?
- rockinroll

```bash
john --wordlist/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt johnkey.hash
```

![thm-brute-it-13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d67924b-2ec7-47f4-b92c-d40449375dbc)

With the passphrase in hand, we can now re-attempt the SSH connection to the target machine:

### WE'RE IN!!!

![thm-brute-it-14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d578ed29-cbcd-4405-a3cd-9ea247803bf0)

```bash
ls
cat user.txt
```

![thm-brute-it-15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0602704f-7321-4a48-9a4c-8fa25cd8355c)

List the commands that the current user is allowed to run with sudo (superuser) privileges.

Looks like "cat" is our friend!

```bash
sudo -l
```

![thm-brute-it-16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3b9abd-f4d3-4a5f-a40d-902d8f199583)

```bash
sudo cat /root/root.txt
```
![thm-brute-it-17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4093b5-4590-4e12-aec0-c87a4a511e79)

Display the contents of the /etc/shadow file that holds encrypted password information for user accounts

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```
![thm-brute-it-18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8971f77f-ac57-4889-9d83-9c899e681b9d)

Save the hash for the root user's account in a format that is suitable for use with John the Ripper.

Execute John to crack the hash and reveal the password for the root user account:

```bash
john --wordlist/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt root.hash
```
